## GCP Overview

### Project infrastructure modules in GCP:
* Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
* BigQuery: Data Warehouse

(Concepts explained in Week 2 - Data Ingestion)

### Initial Setup

For this course, we'll use a free version (upto EUR 300 credits). 

1. Create an account with your Google email ID 
2. Setup your first [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you haven't already
    * eg. "DTC DE Course", and note down the "Project ID" (we'll use this later when deploying infra with TF)
3. Setup [service account & authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project
    * Grant `Viewer` role to begin with.
    * Download service-account-keys (.json) for auth.
4. Download [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup
5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP keys:
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   
   # Refresh token/session, and verify authentication
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   
### Setup for Access
 
1. [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) for Service account:
   * Go to the *IAM* section of *IAM & Admin* https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
   * Click the *Edit principal* icon for your service account.
   * Add these roles in addition to *Viewer* : **Storage Admin** + **Storage Object Admin** + **BigQuery Admin**
   
2. Enable these APIs for your project:
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com
   
3. Please ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env-var is set.
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   ```
 
### Terraform Workshop to create GCP Infra

Run terraform init from terraform directory to initialize your project.
```shell
terraform init
```

```shell
terraform plan
```

```shell
terraform apply
```

you can check in your GCP under ccloud storage, new buckets created.

### Creating compute instance

### Airflow

from airflow directory
```shell
